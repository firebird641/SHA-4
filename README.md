# SHA-4
Enhanced prototype version of the SHA-3 Hashing Algorithm

Uses a Sponge Construction (same as in SHA-3 / Keccak-Algorithm) for generating hash values. Also supports HMAC-Hashing. Supports variable output length (max. 2048 Bit). This is an experimental algorithm that has not been tested. There might be vulnerabilities, analytical or statistical attacks. Use this script only for learning.

The author is a self-taught cryptographer.
